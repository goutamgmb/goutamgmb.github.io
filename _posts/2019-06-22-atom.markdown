We address the problem of estimating accurate bounding box in generic object tracking. We train a target estimation component offline to predict the overlap between the target object and an estimated
bounding box, conditioned on the initial target appearance. We further introduce a target classification component that is trained online to guarantee high discriminative power in the presence of distractors.
