We propose a general and conceptually simple regression method with a clear probabilistic interpretation. We create an energy-based model of the conditional target density p(y|x), using a deep neural network to predict the un-normalized density from (x, y). This model of p(y|x) is trained by directly minimizing the associated negative log-likelihood, approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach outperforms direct regression, as well as other probabilistic and confidence-based methods on four computer vision regression tasks, including object detection and visual tracking.
