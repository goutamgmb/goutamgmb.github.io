We propose an end-to-end trainable tracking architecture, capable of fully exploiting both target and background appearance information for learning the target model. Our architecture is derived from a discriminative learning loss by designing a dedicated optimization process. The proposed tracker sets a new state-of-the-art on 6 tracking benchmarks, while running at over 40 FPS.
