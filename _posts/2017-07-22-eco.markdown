We tackle the key causes behind the problems of computational complexity and over-fitting in advanced DCF trackers. We introduce: (i) a factorized convolution operator, which drastically reduces the number of model parameters; (ii) a compact generative model of the training sample distribution; (iii) a conservative model update strategy. Our approach can operate at 60 Hz on a single CPU, while obtaining competitive tracking performance.
